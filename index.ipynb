To make this process simpler, most developers and data scientists make use of popular regex tester websites, which allow you to put in a block of text and test your patterns by quickly seeing visually what a pattern will grab out of the text block. During this codealong, we strongly recommend you take some time to use a regex tester website such as [Regex Pal](https://www.regexpal.com/) or [regexr](https://regexr.com/) so that you can visually inspect how changing your regex pattern affects your results when working towards a correct answer! \n", "\n", "## Regex Cheat Sheet\n", "\n", "When learning regex, the symbols and notation for patterns can seem a bit intimidating.
